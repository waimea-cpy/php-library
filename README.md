# php-project-library

A set of PHP functions to help my students with their project work, particularly with MySQL DB access and debugging

The library provides functions for:
   * Displaying a small debug info panel at the bottom-right of the page which shows any content in $_GET, $_POST, $_FILES, $_SESSION and a user-defined $DEBUG variable
   * Connecting to MySQL databases
   * Obtaining records from a MySQL database (using prepared statements with option data parameters)
   * Adding / updating records in a MySQL database (using prepared statements with option data parameters)
   * Uploading files to the server
   * Uploading images specifically to the server (with appropriate validation)
   * Downloading files from the server
   * Checking if a given URL exists

Included are files for a simple demo application that shows the library functions in use.
